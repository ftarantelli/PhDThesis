\chapter{Round Trip variation of Hamiltonian parameter}
\label{chp_round}

\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, we analyze the effects of multiple
crossing the quantum and the thermal transitions. In particular,
we consider a round-trip evolution of an hamiltonian parameter
starting from an equilibrium state. The main propose is to
understand the details of the final state if the driving
parameter returns to its initial value.

At first, we focus our attention upon a system which undergoes
a continuous transition. Then, we replace the diverging correlation
length and time with the corresponding typical scales 
characterizing a first order transition.

In fact,
understanding whether similar scaling relations occur when
the system is driven across a quantum/classical phase transition
from an out-of-equilibrium configuration is still not clear.

Below,
we investigate the emergence of finite-size scaling behaviors
during this round-trip driving across the transition point.
