\section{Unitary time-evolution}



%\subsection{Quench}
\subsection{Dynamic Scaling Theory}

In the quench protocol, we define a family of Hamiltonians of type:
\ba{Hquench}
H(\bar \mu) = H_o + \bar\mu P \cm
\ea
where in this case the scaling variable $\bar \mu$ tunes the strength of the perturbation
$P$ such that $\Bigr[ H_o , P] \neq 0$ and $H_o$ is the unperturbed Hamiltonian 
whose parameters assume their critical values.

In this quench protocol, at $t = t_0$ the system starts in the ground state
of the Hamiltonian associated with an initial value $\bar \mu_i$ . Then, at time $t>0$, we
suddenly change the coupling from $\bar \mu$ to $\bar \mu _i$ and we follow the 
corresponding evolution of the system, described by the Schro\"odinger equation
in the form of the Von-Neumann equation:
\ba{eqschrodinger}
\partial_t \rho(t) = -i \Bigr[ \hat H(\bar \mu), \rho(t) \Bigr] \qquad \rho(t=0) = \rho_0 \,\,,
\ea
where $\rho(t)$ is the system density matrix at time $t\,$.

To express a possible scaling law, we define a further scaling variable associated
with the time:
\be{theta_din}
\theta = t \Delta \cm
\ee
which is obtained by recalling that the inverse energy difference of the lowest states
is proportional to the relevant time scale of the critical modes.

In the finite size system $\Delta _L \sim L^{-z}\,$, therefore in the infinite volume limit $L\to +\infty$, the out of equilibrium dynamics show a FSS behavior in which the scaling variable $\theta$ enters in the scaling functions. Hence, for this asymptotic dynamic scaling, we can write the following FSS law related to the correlation functions $F\,$: 
\begin{equation}  
\label{dfss-C}
F(\bm x, \bm y, \bar r;L) \approx u_l^{d+z-2+\eta} \,\mathscr{F}\Bigl(u_l\bm x ,u_l\bm y, \bar r\,u_l^{-1/\nu}, \bigl\{v_i\,u_l^{-y_i}\bigl\},  \bigl\{\widetilde{v}_i\,u_l^{-\widetilde{y}_i}\bigl\}, \theta  \Bigl) \,\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Kibble-Zurek mechanism}

The Kibble-Zurek(KZ) mechanism is related to the amount of final defects after slow
passages through continuous transition, from disordered to the ordered phase 
\cite{kibble1976topology, kibble1980some, zurek1985cosmological, zurek1996cosmological, 
zurek2005dynamics}. This type of out-of-equilibrium process is several studied both
analytically-numericallly \cite{dziarmaga2010dynamics, PSSV-2011-noneqcoll,
chandran2012kibble, rossini2021coherent} both experimentally \cite{weiler2008spontaneous,
ulm2013observation}.

The large-scale modes, associated with the changes of the transition tuning parameter, are
insufficient to equilibrate the long-distance critical correlations. Even in the large
time variation regime, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics grows in the thermodynamic limit.
In other words, when the system evolves, starting from an equilibrium state, the
time-evolution is different from an adiabatic dynamics and the system does not pass 
through equilibrium states.

In this scenario, the out-of-equilibrium regime is always describable in terms of the RG
framework and the equilibrium scaling behaviors can be related by the quantum to classical
mapping \cite{rossini2021coherent, S99}.
