\section{Time-evolution in Open Quantum Systems}


\subsection{Lindblad framework}

To model the weak interaction between the previous quantum model and the surrounding
environment, we consider local external baths each in contact with only site of the system
chain. We work under the Born-Markov and secular approximations, so dissipators 
can be effectively modeled employing Lindblad quantum jump operators $\hat L_x\,$. 
In this limit, the time evolution of the density matrix can be described by Markovian
master equations in the Lindblad form as \cite{BP-openquantumsystembook, TV-2021-dissipativeboundaries, TV-2022-localizedparticleloss}:
\ba{eqlindblad}
	\frac{d\rho}{dt} = {\cal L}[\rho] = 
		-i \Bigr[ H, \rho \Bigr] + \mathbb{D}[\rho] \pc
\ea

where ${\cal L}$ is the Liouville superoperator, and $\mathbb{D}$ is the corresponding 
dissipation term, whose strength is regulated by the coupling $w$:
\ba{dissipator}
	\mathbb{D}[\rho] = & w \sum_{x \in {\cal I}} 
		\mathbb{D}_x[\rho] \cm \\
	\mathbb{D}_x[\rho] = &
		\hat L_x \rho \hat L_x^\dagger - 
		\frac{1}{2} \Bigl\{ \rho, \hat L^\dagger_x \hat L_x \Bigl\} \pc
\ea
where we indicate with ${\cal I}$ the set of the external baths in contact with the
quantum system.

\subsection{Thermal bath}

If we are interested to achieve an equilibrium Gibbs state at some temperature $T$, we
can consider the following modelization of interaction with a thermal bath within 
the Lindblad master equation \eqref{eqlindblad}.
Let us take a  quantum models described by quadratic Hamiltonians \cite{dr2021self}, 
such as that of the fermionic Kitaev model \eqref{Hkitaev}. This provides a relatively 
simple modelization of a thermal bath leading to thermalization in the large-
time limit of the corresponding Lindblad master equation
for the density matrix of the system.

The Kitaev Hamiltonian with open boundary conditions can be diagonalized 
in the Nambu field space by a Bogoliubov transformation \cite{dr2021self, PF70, bla86},
so that we can rewrite it as:
\ba{diagHKitaev}
	\hat H_K(\omega)  = \sum_{k=1} ^L \omega_k \hat b_k^\dagger \hat b_k  \cm
\ea
where $\omega_k$ are values of the spectrum of the Bogoliubov eigenoperators $\hat b_k$
(we are neglecting an irrelevant constant term). Note that both $\omega_k$ and 
$\hat b_k$ depend on the Hamiltonian parameter $\mu\,$. The relation between the
fermionic operators $\hat c_x$ and the Bogoliubov eigenoperators 
$\hat b_k$ can be generally written as \cite{dr2021self, PF70, bla86}:
\ba{basisfrombtoc}
	\hat c_x = \sum_{k=1}^L A_{xk} \hat b_k + B_{xk} \hat b^\dagger _k \cm
\ea
where $A$ and $B$ are appropriate $L{\rm x}L$ matrices depending on $\mu\,$.
Following Refs. \cite{dr2021self, CPR-2022-otto_engine}, we write the dissipator
$\mathbb{D}_T[\rho]$ in the Lindblad master equation \eqref{eqlindblad} in terms of
the Bogoliubov eigenoperators as:
\ba{thermaldissipator}
	\mathbb{D}_T[\rho] = & \gamma \sum_k \bigr[ 1 - f(\omega_k, T) \bigr] 
		\bigl( 2 \hat b_k \rho \hat b_k^\dagger -
			\{ \hat b_k^\dagger \hat b_k, \rho \} \bigl) + \\
		& + \gamma \sum _k f(\omega_k, T) \bigl( 2 \hat b_k^\dagger \rho \hat b_k -
                        \{ \hat b_k \hat b_k^\dagger, \rho \} \bigl) \cm
\ea
where:
\be{thermaldensityfunction}
	f(\omega_k , T ) = \bigl( 1 + e^{\omega_k/T} \bigl)^{-1} \pt
\ee
When using this dissipator term, the Lindblad master equation 
\eqref{eqlindblad} ensures the asymptotic large-time thermalization \cite{dr2021self}.
Therefore,
\ba{thermalstationarystate}
	\lim_{t \to \infty} \rho(t) & = \rho_t(\omega, T ) \cm \\
	\rho_t (w, T ) &  = \sum_n e^{-E_n(\omega)/T} \ket{\phi_n, \omega} 
					\bra{\phi_n, \omega} \cm
\ea
where $\rho_t(\omega,T)$ is the density matrix representing the
thermal state, $E_n (\omega)$ and $\ket{\phi_n, \omega}$ are the eigenvalues
and eigenstates of $\hat H(\omega)\,$. The asymptotic approach to
the thermal distribution is controlled by the decay-rate parameter $\gamma$.

\subsection{Liouvillian gap}
\label{subsec_liouvilliangap}

Let us consider the following equation:
\ba{eigencalL}
	\widetilde{\cal L}[\widetilde \rho_i] = \lambda_i \widetilde \rho_i \cm
	\qquad \lambda_i \in \numberset{C} \pc
\ea
where $\widetilde {\cal L}$ is the (non-hermitian) Lindblad superoperator after the 
Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism 
\cite{BP-openquantumsystembook, VZ-2004-superoperatorvidal}, and $\widetilde \rho_i$ is the
density matrix eigen-operator associated with the complex eigenvalue $\lambda_i$.
In a few words, the transformation we have mentioned sends the density matrix $\rho$ to 
$\widetilde \rho$ through the mapping:
\be{vecrho}
	\rho_{ij} \ket i \bra j  \longrightarrow  \widetilde \rho_{ij} \ket i \ket j \pt
\ee
Therefore, the vectorized $\widetilde \rho$ lives in a $4^L$-dimensional Hilbert space.
In this basis, the action of $\widetilde{\cal L}$ on 
$\widetilde \rho$ can be written as follows:
\ba{vecteqlindblad}
	\widetilde{\mathcal{L}} =& -i \big(\hat{H} \otimes \hat{\mathbb{I}} 
		- \hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes \hat{H}^t \big) + 
		w\sum_{x \in {\cal I}}\hat{L}_{x}\otimes \hat{L}^*_{x}\\
	&-\frac{w}{2}\sum_{x \in {\cal I}}\big(\hat{L}^{\dagger}_{x}\hat{L}_{x}
		\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}}+\hat{\mathbb{I}}
			\otimes\hat{L}^t_{x}\hat{L}^*_{x}\big) \pt
\ea
It can be shown that all eigenvalues of $\widetilde{\cal L}$ satisfy 
$ {\rm Re}{\lambda_i } \le 0$ \cite{BP-openquantumsystembook}. The zero mode of the above 
operator represents the steady-state solution, namely, the NESS of the system. 
If $\hat L_x$ is not hermitian, the density matrix corresponding to the steady-state 
solution is not proportional to the identity matrix \cite{KS-2020-boundarydephasing}. 
We focus on the Liouvillian gap $\Delta_{\lambda}$, which is the non-vanishing eigenvalue
of ${\cal L}$ with the smallest real part:
\ba{Lioulliangap}
\Delta_{\lambda} = - \max_{i} {\rm Re}{\lambda_i } \pt
\ea
This quantity controls the typical relaxation time of the longest-living 
eigenmode differing from the NESS.
