\section{Introduction}

% This chapter is devoted to introduce the basis and the notation associated with the analysis
% of quantum system in the presence of processes which generate the out-of-equilibrium 
% dynamics. In particular, we start from system close their equilibrium quantum transition
% point and, then, we turn on two different time perturbations:

In this chapter, we briefly introduce the main concepts which are the starting point
of all the research statement. We will described the definition of transitions for
many-body systems and some processes that drive out from this equilibrium, like:

\begin{itemize}
	\item
		the unitary round-trip processes whose time-evolution is associated with
		an hermitian Hamiltonian;
	\item
		the dissipation processes in which we put our quantum system in contact with
		external baths.
\end{itemize}

We will always consider models which undergo a continuous quantum transition (CQT)
and/or a first order transition (FOT). 

All these concepts will be explored with more details in the future chapters of the 
work. The aim is to understand the behavior of a quantum system and its dynamics
out of the equilibrium regime. We will use the Out-of-equilibrium
Finite Size Scaling (OFSS) theory to discover the properties of these complex
systems.
