\section{Introduction}

This chapter is devoted to introduce the basis and the notation associated with the analysis
of quantum system in the presence of processes which generate the out-of-equilibrium 
dynamics. In particular, we start from system close their equilibrium quantum transition
point and, then, we turn on two different time perturbations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		an unitary round-trip process whose time-evolution is associated with
		an hermitian Hamiltonian;
	\item
		a dissipation process in which we put our quantum system in contact with
		external baths.
\end{itemize}

% in the case of a non-unitary dynamics associated with a weak dissipation interaction 
% between the quantum system and the external environmental, the master equation for the
% system density matrix $\rho$ in the secular and Born-Markov approximations (for further 
% details see \cite[BP-openquantumsystembook, TV21]):
% \be{evol_rho}
% 	\frac{d\rho}{dt} = - i\bigr[ H, \rho \bigr] + \mathbb{D}(\rho) \pt
